# Boosts

Boosts help you earn more from your pets. There are three types of boosts available.

## Snacks — One-Time Claim Bonus

Snacks give a bonus to your next claim. Each snack can only be used once.

### Available Snacks

| Snack | Bonus | Cost | Net Benefit |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| Cookie | +10% | 60% of bonus | 40% profit |
| Steak | +25% | 55% of bonus | 45% profit |
| Cake | +50% | 50% of bonus | 50% profit |

### How Snack Pricing Works

The cost depends on your pet's daily earnings:

```
Daily Profit = Invested Total x Daily Rate
Bonus Amount = Daily Profit x Bonus Percent
Snack Cost = Bonus Amount x Cost Coefficient
```

### Example

```
Pet: Pixel Fox (invested: 200 XPET, daily rate: 1.2%)
Snack: Steak (+25%)

Daily Profit = 200 x 1.2% = 2.4 XPET
Bonus Amount = 2.4 x 25% = 0.6 XPET
Snack Cost = 0.6 x 55% = 0.33 XPET

You pay: 0.33 XPET
You get extra: 0.6 XPET
Net benefit: 0.27 XPET profit
```

### Snack Rules

- Only **one snack per pet** at a time
- Snack is consumed on your next claim
- Buy a new snack after each use

## ROI Boost — Permanent ROI Increase

ROI Boost increases your pet's maximum profit. The invested amount stays the same.

### Available Boosts

| Boost | Extra Profit | Cost | Net Benefit |
|-------|--------------|------|-------------|
| +5% ROI | invested x 5% | 25% of extra | 75% profit |
| +10% ROI | invested x 10% | 25% of extra | 75% profit |
| +15% ROI | invested x 15% | 25% of extra | 75% profit |
| +20% ROI | invested x 20% | 25% of extra | 75% profit |

### Important

- ROI Boosts do **NOT increase invested total**
- They only increase the ROI cap percentage
- Maximum **+50% total** from all boosts combined
- Boosts are **permanent** until pet evolves

### Example

```
Pet: Glitch Cat (invested: 400 XPET, ROI cap: 170%)
Buying: +10% ROI Boost

Without boost:
  Max Profit = 400 x 170% = 680 XPET

Extra Profit = 400 x 10% = 40 XPET
Boost Cost = 40 x 25% = 10 XPET

With boost:
  New ROI Cap = 170% + 10% = 180%
  Max Profit = 400 x 180% = 720 XPET

You pay: 10 XPET
You get extra: 40 XPET
Net benefit: 30 XPET more profit
```

## Auto-Claim — Subscription Service

Auto-Claim automatically collects rewards from your pets when training is complete.

### Pricing

| Duration | Cost | Per Month |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 month | 5 XPET | 5 XPET |
| 3 months | 15 XPET | 5 XPET |
| 6 months | 30 XPET | 5 XPET |

### Commission

Each auto-claimed reward has a **3% service fee**.

### How It Works

1. Buy an Auto-Claim subscription
2. System automatically claims rewards from pets in "Ready to Claim" status
3. 3% commission is deducted from each claim
4. Rewards (minus commission) added to your balance

### Example

```
Subscription: 3 months = 15 XPET
Pet claim ready: 2.4 XPET

Commission = 2.4 x 3% = 0.072 XPET
You receive = 2.4 - 0.072 = 2.328 XPET
```

### When to Use Auto-Claim

Auto-Claim is useful if you:
- Have multiple pets training
- Can't log in every 24 hours
- Want passive income without manual claims
