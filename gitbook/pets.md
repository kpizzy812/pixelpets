### Understanding the Stats

- **Price (BABY)** — Cost to buy a new pet at BABY level
- **Daily Rate** — Percentage of invested amount earned per day
- **ROI Cap** — Maximum profit as percentage of invested amount
- **Levels** — Cost of pet at each level after upgrades

## Pet Levels

Each pet evolves through **3 levels**:

### BABY
- Starting level when you buy a pet
- Base investment = purchase price

### ADULT
- First upgrade level
- Increases invested amount
- Same daily rate, but higher earnings due to larger investment

### MYTHIC
- Maximum level
- Highest invested amount
- After reaching ROI cap, pet enters Hall of Fame

## Upgrading Pets

### How Upgrades Work

Upgrades **increase your pet's invested amount**, which means higher daily earnings. The daily rate stays the same, but you earn more because your investment is bigger.

### Upgrade Cost Formula

```
Upgrade Cost = Level Price - Current Invested Total
Evolution Fee = Upgrade Cost x 10%
Total Cost = Upgrade Cost + Evolution Fee
```

### 10% Evolution Fee

When upgrading, you pay a **10% fee** on the upgrade amount. This fee is burned and does NOT add to your invested total.

### Example

```
Pet: Bubble Slime (BABY, invested: 5 XPET)
Upgrading to: ADULT (level price: 20 XPET)

Upgrade Cost = 20 - 5 = 15 XPET
Evolution Fee = 15 x 10% = 1.5 XPET
Total Cost = 15 + 1.5 = 16.5 XPET

After upgrade:
- Invested Total = 20 XPET (fee not included)
- Level = ADULT
- Daily Earnings = 20 x 1.0% = 0.2 XPET (was 0.05 XPET)
```

## Pet Slots

You have **3 pet slots** available. This means you can own and train up to 3 pets simultaneously.

## Pet States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Idle | Pet is waiting, not training |
| Training | Pet is in 24-hour training session |
| Ready to Claim | Training complete, rewards available |
| Evolved | Pet reached ROI cap and moved to Hall of Fame |
| Sold | Pet was sold back to the game |

## How to Buy a Pet

## Earnings Example

**Ember Dragon at MYTHIC level:**
- Invested Total: 10,000 XPET
- Daily Rate: 2.5%
- Daily Earnings: 10,000 x 2.5% = **250 XPET per day**
- ROI Cap: 200%
- Maximum Profit: 10,000 x 200% = **20,000 XPET total**
- Days to reach cap: 20,000 / 250 = **80 days**
