# Referrals

Invite friends to Pixel Pets and earn a percentage of their rewards!

## How It Works

1. Share your unique referral link
2. Friends sign up using your link
3. When they claim training rewards, you earn a commission
4. Commissions go up to 5 levels deep!

## Referral Levels

| Level | Commission | Requirement |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Level 1 | 20% | Default |
| Level 2 | 15% | 3 active referrals |
| Level 3 | 10% | 10 active referrals |
| Level 4 | 5% | 25 active referrals |
| Level 5 | 2% | 50 active referrals |

## Example

Let's say you have the following referral chain:

```
You
└── Friend A (Level 1 - you get 20%)
    └── Friend B (Level 2 - you get 15%)
        └── Friend C (Level 3 - you get 10%)
```

When Friend C claims 100 XPET from training:
- Friend B gets: 100 × 20% = 20 XPET
- Friend A gets: 100 × 15% = 15 XPET
- You get: 100 × 10% = **10 XPET**

## Active Referrals

A referral is considered "active" when they:
- Own at least one pet
- Have completed at least one training session
