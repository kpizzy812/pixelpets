# Economy

Understanding the game economy will help you maximize your earnings.

## XPET Currency

XPET is the in-game currency:
- **1 XPET = $1 USD**
- Used to buy and upgrade pets
- Earned from training, referrals, and tasks
- Can be deposited and withdrawn

## How Earnings Work

### Daily Training Cycle

1. **Start Training** — Begin a 24-hour training session
2. **Wait 24 Hours** — Your pet is training
3. **Claim Reward** — Collect your earnings
4. **Repeat** — Start a new training session

### Earnings Calculation

```
Daily Earnings = Invested Total x Daily Rate
```

**Example:**
- You have a Robo-Bunny at ADULT level
- Invested total: 1,000 XPET
- Daily rate: 2.0%
- Daily earnings: 1,000 x 2.0% = **20 XPET per day**

## ROI Cap

Each pet has a maximum amount it can earn before evolving:

```
Maximum Profit = Invested Total x ROI Cap
```

**Example:**
- Robo-Bunny with 180% ROI cap
- Invested: 1,000 XPET
- Max profit: 1,000 x 180% = **1,800 XPET total**

After reaching the ROI cap:
- Pet stops earning
- Pet moves to Hall of Fame
- Slot becomes available for a new pet

## Selling Pets (Early Sell)

You can sell pets before they reach their ROI cap. The commission depends on how much profit you've already claimed.

### Dynamic Sell Commission

| Profit Progress | Commission | You Receive |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| 0% (just bought) | 15% | 85% of invested |
| 25% of ROI | ~36% | ~64% of invested |
| 50% of ROI | ~58% | ~42% of invested |
| 75% of ROI | ~79% | ~21% of invested |
| 100% of ROI (cap reached) | 100% | 0% |

### How It's Calculated

```
Profit Ratio = Profit Claimed / Max Profit
Commission = 15% + (Profit Ratio x 85%)
Refund = Invested Total x (1 - Commission)
```

### Example

```
Pet: Pixel Fox (ADULT level)
Invested Total: 200 XPET
Profit Claimed: 80 XPET
Max Profit: 200 x 160% = 320 XPET

Profit Ratio = 80 / 320 = 25%
Commission = 15% + (25% x 85%) = 36.25%
Refund = 200 x (1 - 36.25%) = 127.5 XPET
```

### Why Dynamic Commission?

The more profit you've extracted from a pet, the less refund you get when selling. This encourages players to either:
- Sell early if they need funds (low commission)
- Hold until ROI cap (maximum total profit)
