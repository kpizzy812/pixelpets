# Economy

Understanding the game economy will help you maximize your earnings.

## XPET Currency

XPET is the in-game currency:
- **1 XPET = $1 USD**
- Used to buy and upgrade pets
- Earned from training, referrals, and tasks
- Can be deposited and withdrawn

## How Earnings Work

### Daily Training Cycle

1. **Start Training** — Begin a 24-hour training session
2. **Wait 24 Hours** — Your pet is training
3. **Claim Reward** — Collect your earnings
4. **Repeat** — Start a new training session

### Earnings Calculation

```
Daily Earnings = Invested Total × Daily Rate
```

**Example:**
- You have an Epic pet (2.0% daily rate)
- Invested total: 5,000 XPET
- Daily earnings: 5,000 × 2.0% = **100 XPET per day**

## ROI Cap

Each pet has a maximum amount it can earn before retiring:

```
Maximum Earnings = Invested Total × ROI Cap
```

**Example:**
- Epic pet with 180% ROI cap
- Invested: 5,000 XPET
- Max earnings: 5,000 × 180% = **9,000 XPET total**

After reaching the ROI cap:
- Pet stops earning
- Pet moves to Hall of Fame
- Slot becomes available for a new pet
